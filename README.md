# Recovers
Recovers is a clean, easy-to-use recovery software framework that can be deployed before a disaster to prepare communities.

This is the repository for all tasks and development related to Huntsville's recovers.org chapter.

Huntsville's community relief hub is located here: https://huntsville.recovers.org/

The task management board for this project is viewable here: https://waffle.io/codeforhuntsville/recovers

We will update this readme as we have more information about this project.
